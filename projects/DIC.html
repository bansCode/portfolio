            <p>
                During my research internship at the University of Toronto, I studied  the reliability of a Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system—an optical, non-contact measurement technique to capture full-field displacement and strain on structural surfaces. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate how accurately the DIC system measures translational and rotational movements under controlled laboratory conditions and to identify factors that influence measurement precision. To test this, I used a DIC setup with dual cameras, a speckle-patterned specimen, and a xyzθ translation stage, which allowed me to apply controlled motions in the x, y, and z directions, as well as angular rotations.
            </p>

            <p>
                I performed a series of accuracy tests using two different specimen geometries—a flat prism and a concrete cylinder—to understand how surface curvature affects the measurement results. For each specimen, I incrementally translated and rotated the object and compared the true motion from the translation stage with the displacement measured by VIC-3D software. The results showed that the DIC system reliably captured vertical, horizontal, and rotational movements with very small absolute errors, often in the micron range. However, the depth (z-axis) measurements exhibited noticeably higher sensitivity and variability, particularly for the cylindrical specimen.
            </p>

            <p>
                Beyond displacement testing, I examined how calibration quality and camera field of view influence the overall accuracy of the system. I compared results from different calibration scores and found minimal performance differences under controlled lighting and setup conditions. In contrast, camera distance had a clear impact—the shorter field of view consistently produced more accurate measurements, especially in depth and horizontal directions. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with high-precision optical measurement tools, learned how experimental setup affects data reliability, and contributed practical insights into optimizing DIC testing workflows for future graduate students in the lab.
