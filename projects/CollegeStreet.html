            <p>
                In this project for team of six, I contributed to the College Street Bikeways Extension project, a Toronto City Council initiative aimed at addressing road safety concerns for cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists along College Street between Ossington Avenue and Shaw Street. The corridor had a history of collisions and presented a critical danger in cycling infrastructure, particularly where existing bike lanes merged with street parking. Our task was to reconfigure the roadway in a way that prioritized user safety while preserving economic activity and meeting accessibility and municipal design standards/regulations.

            <p>
                My responsibilities included analyzing stakeholder needs, evaluating existing road conditions, and participating in the generation and assessment of alternative road layouts. Using technical criteria from the Ontario Traffic Manual, our team explored multiple design concepts before selecting the Luminous BiWay—a bi-directional, physically separated cycle track with dedicated signals and preserved parking capacity. Through dimensional analysis, traffic simulations, and objective-based scoring, we verified that this configuration met safety, mobility, and stakeholder requirements, ultimately presenting a functional and safe solution to improve active transportation on one of Toronto’s busiest cycling corridors.
